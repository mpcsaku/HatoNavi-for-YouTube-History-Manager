        <p>
          To display thumbnails, video titles, and channel names on the history page, we utilize secure, officially provided features of YouTube.<br />
          Although the video ID is sent to YouTube's servers during this communication, this is a basic and secure part of the YouTube website's operation.

        <b>Data is Sent to an External Server Only if Video Information Cannot Be Obtained</b>
        <p>
          If and only if video information cannot be obtained using the method above, the video ID will be sent to cloudfunctions.net, operated by Google, solely to retrieve the title and channel name.<br />
          This communication is also secure, and absolutely no data other than the video ID is transmitted.
